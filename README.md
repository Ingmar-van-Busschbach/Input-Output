This is a project made to test the feasability of using AI posenet style programs in a similar fashion as the xbox 360 kinect, but without any hardware requirements outside of a simple camera.
We tested this by making a game that tests the reaction speed and precision of the program by having the player react to things happening on their screen, or by having the player stand in certain poses.
